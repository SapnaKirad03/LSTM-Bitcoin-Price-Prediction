# LSTM-Bitcoin-Price-Prediction

Bitcoin is a price volatile, which indicates the need for studying the underlying price model.
Here the data between the year 2014 - 2022. It proposed this as Long short-term memory
problem. Here an attempt is made to predict increase/decrease in price. It is performed to predict
increase/decrease price for next 30 days. In this case we have attempted to predict next day
using Machien learning and deep learning algorithms.
